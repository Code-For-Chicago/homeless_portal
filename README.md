# Homelessness Portal
## NDoCH project: Homelessness Portal w/ ChiPubLib
### Project born out of the National Day of Civic Hacking

#### Existing workflow:
- Working out of [Slack][https://uptown-codes.herokuapp.com] channel `#civic-hacking`.
- [GitHub Repository][https://github.com/Code-and-Coffee-Uptown-Brigade/homeless_portal]
- Using `@todobot` to manage tasks
- [] `@Bex` is taking point on the design/ front-end
- [] `@ryan-koch` and `@ben-abrams` are working on the back-end: Falcon API/Middleware stack. Once built, will likely act as a data cache and delivery system for front end.
- [] `@csethna` is supporting with project management and research about neighborhood resources.

#### Needs
- Establish requirements through interactions with stake holders -- `@ben-abrams` `@csethna` `@ryan-koch` (build 'with' not 'for')
- [] establish list of resources `@csethna`
- get [Falcon][https://falcon.io] back-end working `@ryan-koch` & `@ben-abrams`
